# ðŸš² Toronto Bike Accident Directory

This interactive map visualizes **fatal and non-fatal bike crashes in Toronto**, allowing users to filter data by **year and fatality** and see more detailed info about individual crashes by interacting with points. The goal of this project is to raise awareness about bike safety and provide useful insights into accident hotspots.

Features:
**Interactive Map** powered by **Mapbox**  
**Year Slider** to filter crashes by year  
**Fatal & Non-Fatal Crash Filters**  
**Dynamic Popup with Crash Details**  
**Legend with Real-Time Crash Count**   


Notes:
- When applying filters, wait for data to refresh to update crash counts in legend. 
- Data points also do not appear at distant. Must zoom in to render data points in mapbox.
